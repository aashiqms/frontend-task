# JS

Welcome to the JS section of the Frontend Interview repository. This document contains JavaScript coding questions tailored to browser environments, designed to evaluate your proficiency and understanding of client-side JavaScript. Please adhere to the guidelines below while completing these tasks.

## Instructions

* Write clean, efficient, and well-commented JavaScript code.
* Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features and best practices.
* For each question, create a separate JavaScript file named question-<number>.js (e.g., question-1.js).
* Your code should be tested in a browser environment. Consider edge cases and browser compatibility.
* Use comments to explain complex logic or decisions you make in your code.
* Commit your answers to your repository with clear and descriptive commit messages.

## Questions

### Question 1: Array Manipulation

Write a JavaScript function that:

* Takes an array of numbers as input.
* Returns a new array which contains only the even numbers from the original array, each multiplied by 2.
* Ensure that your function handles edge cases, such as passing an empty array or a non-array argument.

### Question 2: Asynchronous Data Fetching

Create a JavaScript function that:

* Makes an asynchronous request to a public API of your choice (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, The Dog API).
* Parses the returned data and logs a specific piece of information to the console (e.g., the title of the first post, the name of a random dog breed).
* Includes error handling for cases like network failures or bad responses.

### Question 3: String Formatting

Implement a JavaScript function that:

* Takes a string as input.
* Returns a formatted version of the string where each word starts with a capital letter and the rest of the letters are lowercase.
* Ensure that your function can handle strings with various combinations of capital and lowercase letters.
